# Game Maker Tutorial - SpaceRocks 
My introduction to GameMaker Studio 2.

## Version 1.0
> This **GameMaker Studio 2 (GMS2)** tutorial will guide budding video game creators through the process of creating their very own fully-functional version of the definitive asteroid space blaster.

> Designed and presented by [Friendly Cosmonaut](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKCKHxkH8zqV9ltWZw0JFig), the "Space Rocks" video tutorials start out with an introduction to GMS2 before outlining how to program movement, attacking & collisions, scoring, lives, sound and effects before adding that final polish.
